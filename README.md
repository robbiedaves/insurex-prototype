# Insurex Prototype

## TODO list
I think the delegate is ok but not for policy
We have the issue that we want some fields to be final, and not overriden by the client
In the current version the client (demo) can override vital functionality from the core.
We need to find a solution using the API to allow us to develop a robust but flexible solution.
